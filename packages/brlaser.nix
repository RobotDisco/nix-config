    longDescription =

       brlaser is an open-source CUPS driver designed specifically for Brother monochrome laser printers and multi-function devices.

       While most Brother printers can use standard printer languages like PCL or PostScript, some models do not. If you have a monochrome Brother laser printer (or multi-function device) and the other open-source drivers are not working, brlaser might be able to help. Additionally, there have been reports of some non-Brother printers working with this driver.

       The software is released under the GNU General Public License, which grants the right to freely use, distribute, and modify the program without requiring any permission from the software's author or any fees.

       The following printers have been reported to work with this driver:
