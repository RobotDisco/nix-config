Things I should do eventually

- Explain the difference between my concept of profiles and modules (as internalized from https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/um1ohu/how_do_you_write_custom_nixos_modules/)
- [X] Make my home-manager config work on both MacOS and Linux
- Figure out seamless way to run nix tasks from emacs and/or simple shell commands (devShell?)
- [X] Merge emacs nix flake back in here.
- Rewrite README.org to:
  - Recommend things to reduce the amount of time it takes to understand Nix.
  - Explain the important thing in my nix flakes since a lot of it basically just how I wrote it.
- Reconcile darktower and arrakis profiles so that I can use my nixos modules on both
- [X] Get gpg-agent working in MacOS
- [X] Re-evaluate nix-darwin for MacOS, see if it is worth it.
- Add Makefile-like tasks (is this doable by the nix command itself?)
  - testing nix configs
  - testing home-manager configs
  - testing emacs configs
  - linting
- Rewrite apps section to encapsulate app definitions from the transformation code I use to minimize boilerplate
- Lean on github actions for now for:
  - dependabot (or something for flake updates)
  - cachix (so I don't have to recompile across instances?)
- Find graceful way to install linux/MacOS shared apps from single source
- Update docs to note that MacOS requires following installs before I can converge my nix-config
  - Nix
  - Homebrew
  - Nix-darwin
- Attempt to modify nix-darwin to work with hardware-specific keyboard mappings
- okta-awscli should be a publicly accessible package I feel
  - same with my fork of brother-laser
- After getting github/CI to automatically update flakes, pin nix/darwin autoupgrades to flake
  https://discourse.nixos.org/t/flakes-and-autoupgrade/12994
- make a service for uhk-agent
